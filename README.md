# Intro
I am Universal82, or Moss Mayfly, if you prefer my real name. I do program [commissions](#moss-comissions)! I prefer working in Rust mostly, but I have history in C++ and Python, though it's been some time since I've worked with them.

# Working On
I'm working on a few projects right now:

# Moss' Commissions
Looking to comission a program? Contact me at mossmayfly@proton.me, please use the subject "COMMISSION" so I can find it in a search easily.

# Something to Note
If you open one of my repos, and none of the code is commented, that's either late-night code, or old code. If it's a repo I'm still actively updating, open an issue letting me know it's uncommented and I'll try to get around to doing that for you. Sometimes I publish my repos as public because I don't mind people seeing what I'm working on there, but that doesn't mean it's for others to look at, sometimes it's just for me. If I'm not writing code intended for other eyes, I usually don't comment it (bad habit, I know, I'm working on it).
